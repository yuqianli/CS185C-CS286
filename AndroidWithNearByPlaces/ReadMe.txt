The package edu.sjsu.cinequest.googleplacesandmaps added the Near By Places functionality to the Cinequest app.. 
It uses the Google Places API and search near by theater, cafe, restaurant, etc within certain radius. 

Google Map doesn't display properly. Need to adapt it to Google Google Maps Android API v2.
